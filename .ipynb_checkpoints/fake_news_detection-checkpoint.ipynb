    "Fake news is currently one of the major buzz words worldwide. With Donald J. Trump's election to the American presidency, the term 'fake news' was lately popularized, thanks to his citing the expression in several of his Tweets. However, the expression dates back to even before the rise of social media platforms. One of such instances is when The New Yorks Sun published a series of articles in August 1835 named 'The Great Moon Hoax' regarding aliens living on the Moon and selling out in large numbers <a id=\"ref-1\" href=\"#cite-brownfield_2020_the\">(Brownfield, 2020)</a>, as seen in the illustration below."

Especially with the current COVID-19 crisis, this phenomenon has gained momentum wherein several conspiracy theories have emerged relying on the ease of creating and sharing unverified content to convince the public. With more and more digitization, the magnitude of fake news is hence becoming more massive <a id=\"ref-2\" href=\"#cite-bhajun_2020_fake\">(Bhajun et al., 2020)</a>."

    "Now-a-days when we get our news from social media, we are easily bombarded with scams, rumors, scheme hypotheses and deluding news. Perceiving truth can be exceptionally difficult when it is all blended in with solid data from genuine sources. If we were able identify the fake information from the actual ones, we would be able to form unbiased opinions. For this reason, various machine learning algorithms are being widely utilized to track, visualize and perform automated fact-checking on social media to segregate out unverified claims <a id=\"ref-3\" href=\"#cite-menczer_2016_misinformation\">(Menczer, 2016)</a>.
